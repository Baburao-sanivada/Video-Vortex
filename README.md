# YouTube Clone with React and Redux Toolkit

This is a YouTube clone built using React and Redux Toolkit.

## Project Setup

Basic code setup was done using `create-react-app`. For routing, we used React Router, and for bundling, we used Parcel. Babel was used as the transcompiler.

- `src/` directory contains the source code for the project.

  - `components/`: This directory contains various components used in the project. Each component is documented with comments explaining its functionality.
